# Hello there, human! 👋
I'm Leah (she/her). Pronounced like lay-ah you know like star wars?
I'm a data geek, open education and open science advocate. 

My work empowers people with the skills needed to get jobs in tech.
I use my privilege to empower others when I can.

I invested in the open source ecosystem and maintain a Python package called stravalib that helps you pull your strava data using their API!

I'm a retired mountain ultra runner turned mountain hiker and crossfitter. In my free time I'm on the trails in the mountains of Colorado with my rescue pup.
